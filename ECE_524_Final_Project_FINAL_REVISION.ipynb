    "With the semester coming to an end, many students find themselves scrambling to find the best schedule that will allow them to complete their schoolwork while still having some free time to enjoy the nice weather outside. Which is why we have decided to use optimization techniques to find the best work schedule for a student with multiple deadlines. To ensure our solution is as optimal as possible, we will be either maximizing the summed priority of the tasks or minimizing added time throughout the whole week.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, we have created five main tasks with the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -End time: This represents the deadline of each task. This parameter is represented using an integer\n",
    "    (Monday = 1...Sunday = 7)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -Duration: This is the estimated amount of minutes needed to complete a task\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -Difficulty: Each task will be rated on a difficulty from 1-3. This is \n",
    "    initialized by the user\n",
    "   \n",
    "    -Priority: This will be a dynamic parameter that changes from day to day based on the difficulty\n",
    "    rating of the task and the deadline.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -Room for error: Sometimes, certain tasks will take longer than expected. Room for error means to\n",
    "    calculate extra hours that can be spent on a task each day. This variable is calculated based on\n",
    "    difficulty and the total length of the task itself  \n",
    "    \n",
    "We also created a list of miscellaneous tasks with smaller durations meant to pop up throughout the week. Such tasks can be: going to the gym, grocery shopping, returning a package, and so on. These tasks will have similar characteristics as above and will disappear from the task array at the end of the day. \n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of the report will go as follows. Section 2 will introduce the different models we plan on presenting and describe various aspects within them. Section 3 will hold the primary code of both models and the optimal schedules, and section 4 will highlight the difference between the two models and draw a conclusion. "

Room for error for example will be a static characteristic that is only initilized at the beginning; whereas completness and priority is updated day by day to determine the best tasks to complete each day. These calculations are as follow:\n",

    "If we look at the results of the two models, we'll notice that the week model will try to work on each task every day until they're all done, which explains why we might see very short instances of a task in a day. Contrarily, the day-by-day model prioritizes performing the more urgent tasks first. Although it has longer times spent on each task, the day-by-day model gives better results because it considers factors like the deadline, duration, and completeness to assign each task an appropriate priority. By maximizing the priority of the tasks performed each day, the day-by-day model becomes able to organize its time better, achieve more efficiently, and offer a more convenient schedule for humans.\n",

    "Common scheduling algorithms/models focus mainly on finding a schedule that finishes all tasks before their deadlines. The results of such models are rigid and offer no relaxation of the constraints, which makes them unsuitable for human consumption. When humans perform tasks, there is often plenty of room for error where not all the time spent on a task is used productively, and each day builds on the results of the previous days. The difficulty, length, and deadlines also contribute a lot to how a task is approached. For that reason, we consider those factors in creating the notion of priority that we try to maximize.\n",

    "    Sometimes there isn't enough time to finish all your tasks which in our case makes an infeasible model.

For example, submitting an 80% done homework is better than submitting nothing. \n",
